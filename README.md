üöÄ Exciting News! Introducing **Diet on the Go** ü•ó‚ú®

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, Diet on the Go, an application designed to make your fitness journey a breeze! üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**How It Works:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Basic Data Input:**
Users kickstart their journey by providing weight, height, and age.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Calculating BMR:**
We employ the Harris-Benedict formula to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), laying the foundation for personalized plans.
\[ BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 \times \text{{weight}}) + (4.799 \times \text{{height}}) - (5.677 \times \text{{age}}) \]

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Determining Maintenance Calories:**
Tailored maintenance calories calculated with user-specific activity levels using PAL factors.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Setting Caloric Goals:**
Users can set goals, creating a calorie deficit or surplus based on their fitness aspirations.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Macronutrient Division:**
Flexible macronutrient selection - protein, fat, and carbs - with detailed caloric breakdown.
\[ 1g carb = 4 cal, 1g protein = 4 cal, 1g fat = 9 cal \]

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Adding Food Items:**
Customize your diet plan by adding food items, each contributing to your total macronutrient intake.

**Technologies Used:**

- Frontend: ReactJS, Mantine UI
- Backend: NestJS
- Database: SQLite
- Authentication: Google OAuth
- Server: Amazon EC2
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
